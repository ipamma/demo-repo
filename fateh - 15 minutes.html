<title>Fateh - 15 Minutes feat Amar Sandhu </title>

Nikleya arraat d9 ad vich kar
Dil mera saaf par maari meri habit (My heart is good but I have bad habits)
I can take a good girl and dress her outfit
She gon' fall in love but she know I ain't about it
Jo meri jaa gosey na hovi je mein tere othan tu pela chall java (Don't be mad if I leave before you wake up)
Cause it's early in the morning your bout to catch a feeling
je mein pandraa minta ch na (If in 15 minutes I)
pandraa minta ch na (In 15 minutes)

How we even end up here
You're so fine probably make a thug shed a tear
I exude dominance case you could probably smell the fear
In another continenet and you will probably end up there
Menu pehla daseya ke ehi gal chalni ni (You told me from the beginning that these things won't work)
pyar mohabbat, gallan mere toh vasdi ni
dil te pauni sat ni (I don't want to hurt your heart)
pher vi tu na hatdi (But you still don't stop)
ethi rakhi akh see kyuki (I put my eye on you because)
tu fateh chakdi (You are awesome/You kill shit)
pr menu pata tenu chahida mera sara time (I know you need all of my time)
If I lived a normal life baby you would've been mine
o you think that I'm a dog the way I leave up in the night
I ain't trying to do you wrong so I can't even do you right

Chorus

Verse 2
Menu fikar tera par tenu fikar kada (I am worried about you, what are you worried about (you're not worried about anything))
Emandar munda billo tora  na mein vada (I don't break promises)
(tora na mein vada)
tere naal banavaga jena tu balavey
billo fer vi nerhe avaga
fer vi nerhere avaga
Kudiya batheriay (Plenty of girls)
par mein na layian geerhia (But I never gave them a look)
khaba tak pauchan li
hun hoey jave dheriyan
Know you gon feel some way
I ain't try to make you wait
Ended up in this way cuz you had me not thinking straight
Jo meri ja gusey nah hovi je mein tenu apan pyaar na dava
Billo menu niho pata see zindagi ki dil chaugi bachuan li mein teretoh dhoor rava

Chorus
